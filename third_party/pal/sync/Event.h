/* Event is an attempt to achieve similar functionality to that provided
by the Windows Event concept.

If AutoReset is true, then the first thread to wake from a Wait() will
set the signal back to false.

If AutoReset is false, then the event remains signaled until you call Reset().

WARNING: Do not try to use this as a semaphore. Even for an AutoReset event,
every call to Signal is not guaranteed to correspond to one call to Wait().
If two threads call Signal, then they might both be setting Signal to true,
before any waiting threads are woken up.
