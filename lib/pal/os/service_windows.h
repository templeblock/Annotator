/* All of the state of your running service

	Instructions
	------------

	* Create an instance of WinService_State
	* Set SvcMain, and inside your SvcMain function, do the following:
		* Call SvcMain_Start(). Return immediately if SvcMain_Start() returns false.
		* Run your startup code.
		* Call ReportSvcStatus() to inform Windows that you are in the WinService_Status::Running state.
		* Run until SvcStopEvent is signaled.
		* Call SvcMain_End().
	* (Optionally set SvcCtrlHandler, if DefaultSvcCtrlHandler is not sufficient for your needs)
	* (Optionally set SvcStopEvent)
	* (Optionally set RunInForeground)
	* Call Run()
